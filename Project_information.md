IMDB Top 250 TV Shows Data Web scraping - Python 

In this project i have scraped IMDB website Data, fetched TOP 250 TV shows data and saved it in .XLSX format.
I have used following libraries listed below:
  1) Requests : To send HTTP Request and to access the website.
  2) BeautiFul Soup : To Parse the HTML and helps to access the tags in HTML code.
  3) openpyxl : To create an excel sheet in the workbook and to save .XLSX file.

To Scrape any website data you must have website link and all the necessary libraries imported in your environment.
